# Introduction

## Installing all packages and loading data sets

```{r}
####set-up####
#====Install tidyverse====#

if (!requireNamespace("tidyverse", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("tidyverse")
}
library(tidyverse)

#====Install and load nycflights13 for flight data====#

if (!requireNamespace("nycflights13", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("nycflights13")
}
library(nycflights13)
if (!requireNamespace("dplyr", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("dplyr")
}

#====call packages====#

library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)


#====Using the flights and airlines dataset====#

data("flights")
data("airlines")

```

# Questions

## Re-writing the code using Dplyr

```{r}
####re-write code####

dist_tbl <- flights |>          # Pipe result to next step
  filter(month == 1) |>         # Filter January flights
  group_by(carrier) |>          # Pipe into group_by()
  summarise(
    mean_distance = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE), 
    sd_distance = sd(distance, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) |>                          # Pipe into arrange()
  arrange(mean_distance)
dist_tbl

```

## Question 3

```{r}
####Question3####
#====Create a data frame with one carrier having only one flight====#

flight1 <- tibble(
  carrier = c("AA", "AA", "AA", "BB"),
  distance = c(1000, 1000, 1000, 1500)
)

#====Group by carrier and calculate mean and standard deviation====#

flight_stats <- flight1 %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_distance = mean(distance),
    sd_distance = sd(distance)  # NA for carrier "BB" as only one observation
  )
cat("As seen below, carriers with only one flight has a standard deviation of NA while those with a standard deviation of 0 is due to carriers having the same distances")
print(flight_stats)

```

## Question 4

```{r}
####Question4####
#====average departure delay per carrier per month and reshape====#

carrier_delay_by_month <- flights %>%
  group_by(month, carrier) %>%
  summarise(avg_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = carrier, values_from = avg_dep_delay)
cat("The average departure delay per carrier per month and reshape")
print(carrier_delay_by_month)

```

## Question 5

```{r}
####Question 5####

prop_flights <- flights|> filter( dep_delay>0 & arr_delay <=0) |>
  summarise(proportion = n()/nrow(flights))
cat("The proportion of flights that were delayed but arrived on or before time")
print(prop_flights)

```

## Question 6

```{r}
####Question 6####
#====routes that more than one airline flies====#

route_count <- flights|> group_by(origin, dest) |> summarise(num_airlines= n_distinct(carrier), .groups = "drop") |> filter(num_airlines>1)
cat("Routes that more than one airline flies")
print(route_count)

#====average arrival delay====#

route_delays <- flights|> filter(!is.na(arr_delay))|> group_by(origin, dest, carrier) |> summarise(aver_arr_delay= mean(arr_delay, na.rm=TRUE), .groups="drop")
route_delays <- route_delays %>%
  left_join(airlines, by = "carrier")
cat("The average arrival delay")
print(route_delays)

#====worst and best average arrival delay====#

route_performance <- route_delays %>%
  group_by(origin, dest) %>%
  summarise(
    best_airline = name[which.min(aver_arr_delay)],
    best_delay = min(aver_arr_delay),
    worst_airline = name[which.max(aver_arr_delay)],
    worst_delay = max(aver_arr_delay),
    .groups = "drop"
  )
cat("The worst and best average arrival delay")
print(route_performance)
#====route with the greatest difference between best and worst performance====#

route_performance <- route_performance %>%
  mutate(delay_difference = worst_delay - best_delay)
greatest_diff_route <- route_performance %>%
  filter(delay_difference == max(delay_difference))
cat("The route with the greatest difference between best and worst performance")
print(greatest_diff_route)

#====reason for difference in worst and best performing airlines====#
cat("Different aircraft models: Some airlines may use older or smaller planes that may have more mechanical issues, affecting punctuality. In contrast, other airlines may use newer or better-maintained aircraft that experience fewer delays.
Maintenance schedules: Delays could be due to regular or unscheduled maintenance issues that might affect specific carriers more than others")
#Aircraft Type and Maintenance
#Different aircraft models: Some airlines may use older or smaller planes that may have more mechanical issues, affecting punctuality. In contrast, other airlines may use newer or better-maintained aircraft that experience fewer delays.
#Maintenance schedules: Delays could be due to regular or unscheduled maintenance issues that might affect specific carriers more than others
